### About me ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**ctsangm/ctsangm** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

1. ğŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on my personal repo.
2. ğŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning source control, build engineering, scripting and system administration.
3. âœŒ  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on home automation and Tesla projects.
4. âš¡  Fun fact: I like 80s music.
